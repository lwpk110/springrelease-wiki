This document is meant to help you migrate your `application.properties` and `application.yml` files for use with Spring Boot 2.4 and above.

== Overview
Spring Boot 2.4 has provided an overhaul of the way that `application.properties` and `application.yml` files are processed.
The updated logic has been designed to simplify and rationalize the way that external configuration is loaded.
It has also allowed us to provide new features, such as `spring.config.import` support.

The updated design intentionally restricts certain property combinations.
This means that you may need to change a few things when upgrading from Spring Boot 2.3 or earlier.



== Legacy Mode
If you're not yet ready to migrate your application to use the new config data processing logic, you'll need to switch back to the legacy mode.
To do this, you should set the `spring.config.use-legacy-processing` property to `true`.

The property needs to be set in the Spring `Environment`.
The easiest way is usually to to add it to the `application.properties` or `application.yml` inside your jar.

For example, you can have a `src/main/resources/application.properties` as follows:

[source,properties]
----
spring.config.use-legacy-processing=true

# any other properties

----



== Simple Scenarios
For many applications, you won't need to make any changes to your existing properties files.
Specifically, if you only have a single `application.properties` or `application.yml` file, you don't use `spring.profiles<.*>` properties and you don't make use of multi-document YAML, then upgrading should just work.

If you do have a more advanced set-up, then you should follow the advice in the rest of this document.



== Multi-document YAML Ordering
If you use multi-document YAML files (files with `---` separators) then you need to be aware that property sources are now added in the order that documents are declared.
With Spring Boot 2.3 and earlier, the order that the individual documents were added was based on profile activation order.

If you have properties that override each other, you need to make sure that the property you want to "win" is lower in the file.
This means that you may need to reorder the documents inside your YAML.



== Profile Specific External Configuration
If you use configuration outside of your jar, and you make use of profile-specific configuration files, you should check that your properties are loaded as expected.
In earlier versions of Spring Boot, an `application.properties` file outside of your jar would not override a `application-<profile>.properties` file inside your jar.

As of Spring Boot 2.4, external file always override packaged files (profile-specific or not).
You can read more about the rationale for this change in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/3845[Issue 3845 on GitHub].
You can also check the {guide}/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-files[update documentation] which describes the new ordering.



== Profile Specific Documents
If you use the `spring.profiles` property, for example in multi-document YAML files, you should migrate to `spring.config.activate.on-profile`.
As with the previous property, you can specify a list of profiles that need to be active for the properties to apply.
You can also use profile expressions such as `(prod & cloud)`

For example, if you have the following `application.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  profiles: "prod"
secret: "production-password"
----

It would be migrated as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "prod"
secret: "production-password"
----



== Profile Activation
The `spring.profiles.active` property should still be used to active specific profiles.
For example, from the command line you can run:

----
$ java -jar myapp.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
----

You can also set it in your `application.properties` or `application.yaml`, but as of Spring Boot 2.4 you cannot set the property in a profile-specific document.
In other words, you can no longer combine it with a document that has a `spring.config.activate.on-profile` property.

Likewise, you can still use the `spring.profiles.include` property, but only in non profile-specific documents.

For example, the second document following configuration is invalid:

[source,yaml]
----
# this document is valid
spring:
  profiles:
    active: "prod"

---

# this document is invalid
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "prod"
  profiles:
    include: "metrics"
----

NOTE: The reason we have introduced this restriction is so that `on-profile` conditions are only evaluated once.
Without this limitation, it would be possible for a `spring.config.activate.on-profile` expression to return a different result depending on when it was evaluated.



=== Profile Groups
With Spring Boot 2.3 and earlier, users would often combine `spring.profiles` with `spring.profiles.include` to expand active profiles.

For example, they might have the following `application.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
spring.profiles: "debug"
spring.profiles.include: "debugdb,debugcloud"
----

This allowed them to run `java -jar --spring.profiles.active=debug` and automatically have the `debug`, `debugdb` and `debugcloud` profiles activated.

If we migrate this example to a Spring Boot 2.4 `application.yaml` we get:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "debug"
  profiles:
    include: "debugdb,debugcloud"
----

As discussed above, it's no longer possible to use `spring.profiles.include` in a profile-specific document so this file isn't valid.

Since this use-case is quite common, we've tried to provide another way to support it.
In Spring Boot 2.4 you can use the {guide}/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-profiles-groups["`profile groups`"] feature.

Profile groups allow you to say:

> if you see profile 'x', also activate profiles 'y' & 'z'

Profile groups are defined with the `spring.profiles.group.<source>` property.
For example, the configuration above would be written as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  profiles:
    group:
      "debug": "debugdb,debugcloud"
----

NOTE: The `spring.profile.group` property cannot be used in profile-specific documents.
You can't use it in a document that also has a `spring.config.activate.on-profile` property.



== Migration Example
Let's walk through an example migration for a Spring Boot 2.3 application.
Say that we have an application ships with an `application.yaml` inside the jar that looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
spring.application.name: "customers"
---
spring.profiles: "production"
spring.profiles.include: "mysql,rabbitmq"
---
spring:
  profiles: "mysql"
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test"
    username: "dbuser"
    password: "dbpass"
---
spring:
  profiles: "rabbitmq"
  rabbitmq:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5672
    username: "admin"
    password: "secret"
----

In addition, a `application-prod.yaml` file is included next to the jar when the app is deployed:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    username: "proddbuser"
    password: "proddbpass"
  rabbitmq:
    username: "prodadmin"
    password: "prodsecret"
----

To migrate the application, we can start by updating the `application.yaml` packaged in the jar to use the new property names:

[source,yaml]
----
spring.application.name: "customers"
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "production"
  profiles:
    include: "mysql,rabbitmq"
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "mysql"
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test"
    username: "dbuser"
    password: "dbpass"
---
spring:
config:
  activate:
    on-profile: "rabbitmq"
  rabbitmq:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5672
    username: "admin"
    password: "secret"
----

This almost works, except that we've tried to use `spring.profiles.include` in a profile-specific document.
We can migrate that property by using profile groups:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: "customers"
  profiles:
    group:
      "production": "mysql,rabbitmq"
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "mysql"
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test"
    username: "dbuser"
    password: "dbpass"
---
spring:
config:
  activate:
    on-profile: "rabbitmq"
  rabbitmq:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5672
    username: "admin"
    password: "secret"
----

At this point our migration is complete and things should behave as before.
The production instance can set the profile in the usual way (for example with a `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod` system environment variable) and the previous `application-prod.yaml` file will be picked up.

If we want to, we can rename `application-prod.yaml` to `application.yaml` since with Spring Boot 2.4 all external files override internal ones.
